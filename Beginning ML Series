This post is part of my beginning machine learning series. 
The series includes the following:

01 - Beginning Numpy
02 - Beginning Tensorflow
03 - Beginning PyTorch
04 - Beginning Pandas
05 - Beginning Matplotlib
06 - Beginning Data Scaling
07 - Beginning Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
08 - Beginning Machine Learning Anomaly Detection - Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor
09 - Beginning Unsupervised Machine Learning - Clustering - KMeans and DBSCAN
10 - Beginning Supervise Learning - Machine Learning - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Metrics
11 - Beginning Linear Regression - Machine Learning
12 - Beginning Deep Learning - Anomaly Detection with AutoEncoders, Tensorflow
13 - Beginning Deep Learning - Anomaly Detection with AutoEncoders, PyTroch
14 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Linear Regression, Tensorflow
15 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Linear Regression, PyTorch
16 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Classification, Tensorflow
17 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Classification, Pytorch
18 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Classification - regression - MIMO - Functional API Tensorflow 
19 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Convolution Networks - Tensorflow
20 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Convolution Networks, PyTorch
21 - Beginning Regularization - Early Stopping, Dropout, L2 (Ridge), L1 (Lasso)
23 - Beginning Model TFServing

But conn.log is not the only file within Zeek. Let's build some Unsupervised models for a DNS and HTTP logs
24 - Continuing Anomaly Learning - Zeek DNS Log - Machine Learning
25 - Continuing Unsupervised Learning - Zeek HTTP Log - Machine Learning
26 - Beginning - Reading Executables and Building a Neural Network to make predictions on suspicious vs suspicious

With 26 notebooks in this series, it is quite possible there are things I could have or should have done differently. 
If you find any thing you think fits those criteria, drop me a line.

Have fun!
