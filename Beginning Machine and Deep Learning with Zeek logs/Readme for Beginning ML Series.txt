### Why this series?
When teaching the SANS SEC595: Applied Data Science and Machine Learning for Cybersecurity Professionals 
**https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/applied-data-science-machine-learning/** I am always asked,
"Will you be sharing your demo notebooks?" or "Can we get a copy of your demo notebooks?" or ... well you get the point.
My answer is always no. Not that I do not want to share, (sharing is caring :-D) , but the demo notebooks 
by themselves, would not make sense or add real value. Hence, this series! 

This is my supplemental work, similar to what I would do in the demos but with a lot more details and references.


### The series includes the following: <br>
01 - Beginning Numpy <br>
02 - Beginning Tensorflow  <br>
03 - Beginning PyTorch <br>
04 - Beginning Pandas <br>
05 - Beginning Matplotlib <br>
06 - Beginning Data Scaling <br>
07 - Beginning Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <br>
08 - Beginning Machine Learning Anomaly Detection - Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor <br>
09 - Beginning Unsupervised Machine Learning - Clustering - K-means and DBSCAN <br>
10 - Beginning Supervise Learning - Machine Learning - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Metrics <br>
11 - Beginning Linear Regression - Machine Learning <br>
12 - Beginning Deep Learning - Anomaly Detection with AutoEncoders, Tensorflow <br>
13 - Beginning Deep Learning - Anomaly Detection with AutoEncoders, PyTroch <br>
14 - Beginning Deep Learning - Linear Regression, Tensorflow <br>
15 - Beginning Deep Learning - Linear Regression, PyTorch <br>
16 - Beginning Deep Learning - Classification, Tensorflow <br>
17 - Beginning Deep Learning - Classification, Pytorch <br>
18 - Beginning Deep Learning - Classification - regression - MIMO - Functional API Tensorflow <br> 
19 - Beginning Deep Learning - Convolution Networks - Tensorflow <br>
20 - Beginning Deep Learning - Convolution Networks - PyTorch <br>
21 - Beginning Regularization - Early Stopping, Dropout, L2 (Ridge), L1 (Lasso) <br>
22 - Beginning Model TFServing <br>

But conn.log is not the only log file within Zeek. Let's build some models for DNS and HTTP logs. <br>
I choose unsupervised, because there are no labels coming with these data. <br>

23 - Continuing Anomaly Learning - Zeek DNS Log - Machine Learning <br>
24 - Continuing Unsupervised Learning - Zeek HTTP Log - Machine Learning <br>

This was a specific ask by someone in one of my class. <br>
25 - Beginning - Reading Executables and Building a Neural Network to make predictions on suspicious vs suspicious  <br><br>

With 25 notebooks in this series, it is quite possible there are things I could have or should have done differently.  <br>
If you find any thing, you think fits those criteria, drop me a line. <br>

If you find this series beneficial, I would greatly appreciate your feedback.

This file represents Zeek (formerly Bro) connection log - conn.log`. <br>
Zeek is a framework used for Network Security Monitoring.  <br>
This entire series is based on using Zeek's data.  <br>
The majority of the notebooks use the conn.log <br>
You can learn more about Zeek here:
