This post is part of my beginning machine learning series. 

Why this series?
When teaching the SANS SEC595: Applied Data Science and Machine Learning for Cybersecurity Professionals 
**https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/applied-data-science-machine-learning/** I am always asked,
"Will you be sharing your demo notebooks?" or "Can we get a copy of your demo notebooks?" or ... well you get the point.
My answer is always no. Not that I do not want to share, (sharing is caring :-D) , but the demo notebooks 
by themselves, would not make sense or add real value. Hence, this series! 

This is my supplemental work, similar to what I would do in the demos but with a lot more details and references.

The series includes the following:
01 - Beginning Numpy
02 - Beginning Tensorflow
03 - Beginning PyTorch
04 - Beginning Pandas
05 - Beginning Matplotlib
06 - Beginning Data Scaling
07 - Beginning Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
08 - Beginning Machine Learning Anomaly Detection - Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor
09 - Beginning Unsupervised Machine Learning - Clustering - K-means and DBSCAN
10 - Beginning Supervise Learning - Machine Learning - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Metrics
11 - Beginning Linear Regression - Machine Learning
12 - Beginning Deep Learning - Anomaly Detection with AutoEncoders, Tensorflow
13 - Beginning Deep Learning - Anomaly Detection with AutoEncoders, PyTroch
14 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Linear Regression, Tensorflow
15 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Linear Regression, PyTorch
16 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Classification, Tensorflow
17 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Classification, Pytorch
18 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Classification - regression - MIMO - Functional API Tensorflow 
19 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Convolution Networks - Tensorflow
20 - Beginning Deep Learning, - Convolution Networks, PyTorch
21 - Beginning Regularization - Early Stopping, Dropout, L2 (Ridge), L1 (Lasso)
23 - Beginning Model TFServing

But conn.log is not the only file within Zeek. Let's build some models for DNS and HTTP logs. 
I choose unsupervised, because there are no labels coming with these data.

24 - Continuing Anomaly Learning - Zeek DNS Log - Machine Learning
25 - Continuing Unsupervised Learning - Zeek HTTP Log - Machine Learning

This was a specific ask by someone in one of my class.
26 - Beginning - Reading Executables and Building a Neural Network to make predictions on suspicious vs suspicious

With 26 notebooks in this series, it is quite possible there are things I could have or should have done differently. 
If you find any thing, you think fits those criteria, drop me a line.

--------------------

Nearly all of the notebooks in this sereis, uses the Zeek formerly Bro) connection log - conn.log`. 
Zeek is a framework used for Network Security Monitoring. 
This entire series is based on using Zeek's data. 
You can learn more about Zeek here:
